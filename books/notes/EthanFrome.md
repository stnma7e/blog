Ethan Frome
====

Jeez, this book is absolutely brutal. I’m starting the review before I’ve finished because I’m hungover on New Year’s Day and can’t take the tension that’s building towards the climax. I like to talk about how Virginia Woolf transports you into the heads of her characters with her stream-of-consciousness writing and stylistic use of syntax. This book uses neither device, but nonetheless, I get out of a reading session battered. It takes me some time to come back to reality and evict the empathic effusions of doom.

The entire novel is written against a backdrop of impending tragedy. Of course, we have to wait until the end to find out what it is. In the meantime Wharton meticulously sows an affection, an intimacy, in our hearts. One that anguishes at each delivery of misery. One that raptures in the joys that contrast.

Ethan is the clearly written hero of the story, and Zeena is the villain. Ethan’s thoughts and feelings come to us clearly and directly through the narrator. While the picture we get of Zeena comes mostly through Ethan’s perceptions of her actions and his thoughts on her. There are a few instances of true omniscience from the narrator that gives us a more objective/detached commentary on their relationship. 

The book takes an interesting look at villany, and the conditions in which it arises. Our villain is barely that. She’s a hypochondriac, with awful doctors. She has no extraordinary proclivities for chaos, but her condition sort of precipitates evil as a byproduct. The introduction to my copy had some interesting notes on contemporary treatments for depression (or hysteria as-labeled for women). Wharton was effectively subjected to the same treatment that Zeena was: inaction and instructed helplessness. For Wharton it apparently helped despite its general inefficacy by giving her space for her writing. But as a general rule, it only served to drive women who were already suffering from a lack of agency further towards insanity.

* Zeena as the villain
  * What’s her villany? Hypochondria. She’s not a particularly bad person, but her condition sort of invites/instantiates/summons evil as a byproduct.   
  * The introduction had some interesting notes on the fact that Wharton was effectively subjected to the same treatment that Zeena was (of inaction and instructed helplessness), and while it apparently opened doors for her writing, as a general rule it only served to drive to insanity women who were already suffering from the consequences brought about by lack of agency.  
  * Zeena claims that Ethan only married her owing to propriety. Ethan claims he only married her owing to loneliness.   
* Writing style / delivery
  *
* Purpose of various characters
  * How does Mattie/Ethan compare to Zeena/Ethan
    * Would Mattie end up the same way as Zeena eventually?
    * If Zeena died, would the cycle continue with Mattie becoming the hypochondriac?
      * It sounds like Zeena had pre-existing issues, just that Ethan didn’t know about them since she was working
    * Is Ethan the common link in all the tragedy? Is the farm cursed? Etc.
  * What role does Hale play?
    * He’s kind of the only interaction Ethan has with the outside world
      * The only time we get to see Ethan acting/speaking in public
      * It sounds like they get along well, and exchange normal pleasantries. Mrs. Hale feels bad for him, etc.
    * This is in contrast with his behavior at the dance which he demonstrably did not feel a part of
  * There aren’t many so they’re all probably important
    * Jotham, the narrator / first chapter person, etc.
* Does race play out in this story at all?
  * The characters are natives, and there are references to brown skin, dark eyes/hair, clans, etc.
  * But it doesn’t really feel like that culture comes out at all. The cultural doings of all the characters seem quite in line with my expectations for rural America \~1900
  * In his interactions with the townsfolk I somewhat expected to see them act differently around him, but it didn’t seem like it. Everyone seems nice and friendly as you’d expect them to be for a white person
  * Even Mattie is desired by the son of the influential townsperson, and seems to be well liked at the dance

In the meantime Wharton is (committedly, seriously, masterfully) tending the (hardy plant) of our (affection, but more intimate; more like familial; *knowing* someone, not just liking them)   
*I like the farm analogy here*

After Wharton’s had time to sow affection, let its seeds wriggle for hold and grow into strong roots.
